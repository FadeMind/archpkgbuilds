version 1.0.1
fix bug:
- On interactive mode, checking if the two passphrases are the same fails something when stdin buffer isnt emptied before reading the first password.

","(comma) is not a valid mount point path. the cli prevents this but the GUI just fails without informing a user why. Added a dialog to inform a user
when they select comma as a mount point.

comma as a mount point is disallowed because it sits right next to "dot" button and most people(ie. me) usually press "."(dot) key to mean "present working directory"
but will miss the key and press comma key and start wondering why things arent they way they are supposed to be.
The comma key should have been on the other side of the keyboard!!!

version 2.0
add support for adding and deleting keys in luks based volumes in the cli and gui.

version 3.0
add support for creating both plain and luks based volumes in both files and partitions.

version 4.0
-- host UI blocking code in a different threads to remove/minimize UI freezes
-- use only cryptsetup.so library to interface with cryptsetup
-- allow a user to select what random number generator to use

-- include partitions in /etc/crypttab in a list of system partitions.

version 4.1.0
-- minor update, fix bugs comming from mishandling of files and paths with empty spaces in them.

-- fix a bug. fat based volumes mounted with wrong permissions and only root user could write to the opened volume
-- volumw property now displays file system type, volume size, volume size used, volume size available and percentage used.
-- Fix a bug that prevented adding a new key from key file to a luks volume when the existing key was from a passphrase.
-- The password dialog had a bug and did not reset properly when the previous operation involved opening a keyfile.
-- Add an option to close all opened volumes with a single click.
-- Created volumes with extX file systems now use 1% reserved space instead of the default 5%.

version 4.3.2
-- ext3/ext4 can not be mounted with user specified permissions and they use the permissions set when the volume was last mounted.
    This creates a problem on freshly created volumes because they always end up owned by root. This update fix the problem by setting
    permissions everytime a volume is opened in read/write mode. If a volume open with root as owner, then reopen the volume in read/write
    mode and permissions will be set properly(0700 with the owner being the user who opened the volume)

-- fix bug:volumes did not close properly if mount point had a space character among others in it
-- feature added:users who are members of "zulumount-exec" group will have their volumes opened with "exec" mount option.
   This will allow them to be able to execute commands from the mount point.The default and recommended option is not mount with "noexec" option.
-- feature added:A "-M" option is added that will create a publicly accessible "mirror" of a mount point in "/run/share" from the private
   original one created in "/run/media/$USER.This option is there to allow a user to mount a volume and have it accessible from other users of the system.
-- zuluMount-gui now adds and removed from its list as devices are added and removed from the system.A right click context menu option can be set to allow
   unencrypted volumes to also be automounted.

version 4.6.6
-- fix a regression,retrieving keys from kwallet using volume UUID broke.
-- volumes in gnome are now stored in libsecret and no longer in libgnome-keyring
-- add a GUI window in zuluCrypt-gui to manage keys in libsecret wallet,internal wallet and kde kwallet.
-- add an internal system that can securely store keys independently of kde kwallet and gnome libsecret.Useful to those who
   want to store keys securely but dont want gnome or kde dependencies
-- add compile time option to use mount points in user home directory instead of "/run/media/private"
-- NOTE: changes in management of wallets are not backward compatible and hence volumes will have to be readded after the update.My
   apologies for the inconvenience.
-- drop support for updating /etc/mtab and remove libmount as a required dependency
-- add a Qt5 port,see build instrunctions on how to build Qt5 version

version 4.6.7

   -format is:one entry per line,example entry: UUID="abcf" uid=500
-- fix a bug,if udev is enabled,mounted image files were always treated as system volumes.
-- use libgcrypt for stand alone file encryption instead of cryptsetup.Newer stand alone encrypted files will have an extension of ".zC" to
   distinguish them from previous ones that use ".zc".Older versions of zuluCrypt(<4.6.9) will not be able to open encrypted files that
   end with ".zC".
-- add an option in zuluCrypt GUI to specify a truecrypt volume type when saving or restoring a truecrypt header from a backup header file

-- fix a bug that hanged zuluMount-gui on failed attempt at unlocking a plain dm-crypt volume at a none zero offset.a plain dm-crypt volume at
   a none zero offset can be used as a hidden volume ala TrueCrypt hidden volume feature.No protetcion of hidden volume though.

version 4.7.5
-- add abilities in zuluMount-gui to hide useless entries like windows recovery partitions from view.
   These entries can be set to show/hide through tray icon context menu.
-- add ability to mount and unmount encfs volumes in zuluMount-gui.A folder with encrypted files can be unlocked by dragging
   it and then dropping it on zuluMount-gui main window.
-- add ablity to create TrueCrypt volumes using a passphrase together with one or more keyfiles.Previous versions allowed
   creation of volumes using either a passphrase or a single keyfile.
-- add support for opening of VeraCrypt volumes(cryptsetup > 1.6.6 required).

version 4.7.6

-- add support for creating LUKS volumes that only uses a detached header.The detached header will be created in the
   user home directory and the volume can not be unlocked without this detached header.The detached header can be
   reattached later on through zuluCrypt-gui->menu->Volumes->Restore Volume Header.
-- its now possible to create a shared mount point when unlocking a volume in zuluCrypt-gui
-- its now possible to unlock VeraCrypt volumes from favorite feature in zuluCrypt-gui
-- add complete French translation to both zuluCrypt-gui and zuluMount-gui
-- try to silently solve problems caused by other tools mounting zuluCrypt's encryption mapper.
-- add support for creating a "plain dm-crypt" volume at a "none zero offset".This type of volume is useful as a
   "poor man's version of a hidden volume feature in TrueCrypt and VeraCrypt".Best thing about this type of hidden
   volume is that the outer volume can be anything including an "exposed file system".Currently,only zuluMount-gui can
   open this type of volume by clicking "options" followed by "Set Volume Offset" on the mounting dialog prompt.
-- Qt5 is now the default Qt dependency.
